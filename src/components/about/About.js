                    I'm an enthusiastic person who can learn quickly and easy to adapt. I love to search and explore something new. Iâ€™m active in projects, organizations, and activities on my campus. But also, I have really good responsibility and focus when I have a job to do. I do love to help others and I can work professionally in a team, collaboration, and support each other.
                    My goal is to become a backend developer and data engineer.
